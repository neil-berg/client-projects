            Operação Lava Jato was a corruption and money laundering scandal
            that engulfed Brazilian politics in the Spring of 2016. Although the
            Federal Police have evidence showing the involvement of virtually
            every political party, The Brazilian Democratic Movement Party used
            the scandal to remove the incumbent Labor Party, including then
            President Dilma Rousseff, from power.

            <p class="item__text">
              Operação Lava Jato translates to Operation Car Wash, referring to
              the currency exchange and money transfer service at the Posto da
              Torre (Tower Gas Station) in Brasília that ring of money changers
              used to to move funds acquired by illicit means.
            </p>
            <p class="item__text">
              Operação Lava Jato articulates a complex political situation
              through the voices of ordinary people by asking local car wash
              workers, what's the difference between laundering money and
              washing cars?
